                <p>I started my programming journey on January 13, 2023. Initially, I started with C ++, but it didn't give me much satisfaction and after 2 days, on January 15, 2023, I started learning another programming language, which was HTML, with it I also combined CSS. I have done many website designs from portfolios to shop websites. I am currently learning another programming language which is Java Script. I know that my path with programming is just beginning and I am sure that I will go further ahead to be able to create websites for companies or individuals in the future.</p>
